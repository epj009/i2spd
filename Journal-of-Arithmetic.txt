**===== 11/20 morning session; start @ 0555, finish @ 0605**

Up really early this morning but had to spend a big chunk of time catching-up
from being on the road all day yesterday in RC (TAACCCT "GroundWorks").

I should be able to get to the arithmetic exercises this evening and I should
also be able to move through them at a fair clip. I don't, however, want to be
hasty with the material because I can already see there are some good concept
lessons here.
