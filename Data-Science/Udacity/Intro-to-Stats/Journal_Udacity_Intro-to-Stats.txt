**===== 02/12 morning; start @ 0555, finish @ 0620 = 25

Finished section 8, probability. Watch the last solution again.


**===== 02/11 morning; start @ 0455, finish @ 0625 = 90

A tough probabilty question with involving a loaded coin, but after a struggle,
I got it.  Now it's on to a new probability problem involving dice. It seems
the truth table will be really big, so I took a look at a Khan Academy video
about probability and combinatorics. Fun, but it's getting harder. :-)


**===== 02/10 morning; start @ 0530, finish @ 0630 = 60
                       start @ 2200, finish @ 2230 = 30

Probability. Also watched 15 minutes of Sal Khan talking about probability. Then
spent 15 minutes glancing at Carnegie-Mellon's prob/stats course on OLI.


**===== 02/09 morning; start @ 0530, finish @ 0700 = 90

Completed sections 5, 6, and 7. Stopping at section 8 (probability) because I'm
pretty confident the kids will awaken soon. This was a good study session and
I think I'm finally "primed" to really move forward with this stuff. It's quite
interesting and this course does a nice job with the material.


**===== 02/08 afternoon; start @ 1310, finish @ 1340 = 30

Read the Head First Statistics book on the couch (casually). No commit to Git.


**===== 02/07 evening; start @ 2055, finish @ 2105 = 10

Ever so quickly did I even look at stats today. Bad dog. No commit to GitHub.


**===== 02/06 evening; start @ 2245, finish @ 2315 = 30

Crazy work day. Just finished a timeline for the Chancellor and Commissioner.

7/9 of the way through pie charts.


**===== 02/05 evening; start @ 2130, finish @ 2200 = 30

Happy Birthday, Mom.

Udacity, Intro. to Stats, scatter plots. Two little modules left that I'll
"sleep on" before completing in the morning.


**===== 02/04 evening; start @ 2140, finish @ 2205 = 25

Putting down HtDP-2 for awhile and picking-up the free online Udacity course,
"Intro to Stats, Making Decisions Based on Data".

Finished intro and unit #1. Start with unit #2 tomorrow morning.
