**===== 02/25 evening; start @ xxxx, finish @ yyyy = 10

Spent time tonight on resume.


**===== 02/23 evening; start @ 2230, finish @ 2240 = 10

Khan Academy fair value accounting.


**===== 02/22 evening; start @ 2223, finish @ 2233 = 10

Spent last night and today reading-up on accounting & bookkeeping procedures due
to the recent activities at work. I really should be sharper with this stuff
anyway. I spent a good 30 minutes last night and 20 minutes today reading my
financial accounting textbook. I also spent a good 20 minutes on Khan Academy
today.

Oy! That conditional probability problem from Udacity, that is, the two coins in
a bag (one loaded 0.9H 0.1T; one fair; pull a coin, flip, what's the probability
of heads?). Jeremy looked at it in 5 seconds and had the right answer without
the truth tables. Discouraging to me. Today I'm just discouraged about many
things. I'll move on and get over it, but it's pretty frustrating that almost
every concept seems to come to me in pieces, very slowly.

Move on. Tomorrow is another day.


**===== 02/20 morning; start @ 0625, finish @ 0635 = 10

This is the biggest gap in my study efforts that I can recall for quite some
time. Being sick is one reason but being asked to research the state of a number
of projects at the college is another.

Here's what I've concluded: the situation at VTC causes me more concern than I
can ever recall in the past 17 years, and as such, I have to put my energies
toward seeking alternate employment opportunities.

I will not quit my daily learning but I'm changing my daily minimum commitment
level to 10 minutes (with 15 or more being ideal). Forward...


**===== 02/17 evening; start @ 2040, finish @ 2050 = 10

I've been sick as a dog for two days; eyes watered so much I couldn't even look
at the monitor.  Back now, eyes still watering a bit but I'm going to give stats
a go here.

**===== 02/14 morning; start @ 0545, finish @ 0705 = 80

Left off at the "two coins in a bag" problem. I'll think about that one, but I
know the development of truth tables is key here.


**===== 02/13 morning; start @ 0605, finish @ 0630 = 25

Sebastian's section 8 summary -- we learned:

+ probability of an event P
+ probability of an opposite event 1-P
+ probability of a composite event, a.k.a independence, P*P*P...P

In the example given in chapter 9, conditional probability, the outcome of the
test *depends* on whether the patient has cancer or not.

P(CANCER)  = 0.1
P(nCANCER) = 0.9
P(POSITIVE | CANCER) = 0.9 
P(NEGATIVE | CANCER) = 0.1
P(POSITIVE | nCANCER) = 0.2
P(NEGATIVE | nCANCER) = 0.8


**===== 02/12 morning; start @ 0555, finish @ 0620 = 25

Finished section 8, probability. Watch the last solution again.


**===== 02/11 morning; start @ 0455, finish @ 0625 = 90

A tough probabilty question involving a loaded coin, but after a struggle, I
got it.  Now it's on to a new probability problem involving dice. It seems the
truth table will be really big, so I took a look at a Khan Academy video
about probability and combinatorics. Fun, but it's getting harder. :-)


**===== 02/10 morning; start @ 0530, finish @ 0630 = 60
                       start @ 2200, finish @ 2230 = 30

Probability. Also watched 15 minutes of Sal Khan talking about probability. Then
spent 15 minutes glancing at Carnegie-Mellon's prob/stats course on OLI.


**===== 02/09 morning; start @ 0530, finish @ 0700 = 90

Completed sections 5, 6, and 7. Stopping at section 8 (probability) because I'm
pretty confident the kids will awaken soon. This was a good study session and
I think I'm finally "primed" to really move forward with this stuff. It's quite
interesting and this course does a nice job with the material.


**===== 02/08 afternoon; start @ 1310, finish @ 1340 = 30

Read the Head First Statistics book on the couch (casually). No commit to Git.


**===== 02/07 evening; start @ 2055, finish @ 2105 = 10

Ever so quickly did I even look at stats today. Bad dog. No commit to GitHub.


**===== 02/06 evening; start @ 2245, finish @ 2315 = 30

Crazy work day. Just finished a timeline for the Chancellor and Commissioner.

7/9 of the way through pie charts.


**===== 02/05 evening; start @ 2130, finish @ 2200 = 30

Happy Birthday, Mom.

Udacity, Intro. to Stats, scatter plots. Two little modules left that I'll
"sleep on" before completing in the morning.


**===== 02/04 evening; start @ 2140, finish @ 2205 = 25

Putting down HtDP-2 for awhile and picking-up the free online Udacity course,
"Intro to Stats, Making Decisions Based on Data".

Finished intro and unit #1. Start with unit #2 tomorrow morning.
