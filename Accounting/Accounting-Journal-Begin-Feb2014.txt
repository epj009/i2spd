Focused on the parts of each of the parts of financial statements:  balance
sheet, income statement, statement of the change in OE, statement of cash flows.
Used the MMV textbook to recreate a diagram of these financial statement comp-

Also kept referring to Bart's income statement for VFA, trying to make sense of
it.

Some thoughts:

+ (p. 1) To finance and extract cash from the actions of the enterprise is not
boring at all. It is the essence of business and the generation of wealth.

+ (p. 9-10) Get the vocabulary here down-pat; memorize rotely.

+ (p. 11) Memorize the 12 accounting principles by name, then by process.
 => accounting entity
 => going concern
 => measurement
 => units of measure
 => historical cost
 => materiality
 => estimates and judgements
 => consistency
 => conservatism
 => periodicity
 => substance over form
 => accrual base of presentation
