;; *HtDD*: establish represent/interpret relation btwn info. & data
;; Structure Definition (for compound data)
; PROBLEM A: You work in the Human Resources department at a ski 
; lodge. Because the lodge is busier at certain times of year, the
; number of employees fluctuates. There are always more than 10,
; but the maximum is 50. Design a data definition to represent the
; number of ski lodge employees. Call it Employees.


;; Type Comment -- this is an interval data type
; Employees is Integer[11, 50]

;; Interpretation
; interp. the number of current ski lodge employees


;; Examples -- this step seems unnecessary, but isn't!
(define E1 11)
(define E2 40)
(define E3 50)


;; Template for a one argument function
; (define fn-for-employees emp)
;   (... emp)


;; Template Rules Used:
;  - atomic non-distinct: Integer[11, 50]


; *HtDF*: PROBLEM B: Now design a function that will calculate the
; total payroll for the quarter. Each employee is paid $1,500 per
; quarter. Call it calculate-payroll.
;; Signature
;; =========
;; (HtDP-2: express how info. will be represented as data)
;; Employees -> Natural


;; Purpose: (HtDP-2: what does the function compute?)
;; ==================================================
; consume an Employees and produce a number representing the
; payroll amount for the quarter.



;; Stub; define examples; wrap each in a check-expect
;; ==================================================
;(define (calculate-payroll pr) 0)       ;; Stub
;; given x, expect y                     ;; from HtDP-2
;; given a, expect b                     ;; from HtDP-2
(check-expect (calculate-payroll 5) 7500)
(check-expect (calculate-payroll  E1) 16500)
(check-expect (calculate-payroll  E2) 60000)
(check-expect (calculate-payroll  E3) 75000)


;; Inventory -- template & constants
;; =================================
;(define (calculate-payroll pr)          ;; Template
;  (... pr))                             ;; copy this template for coding


;; Code the body; test & debug
;; ===========================
(define (calculate-payroll pr)
  (* 1500 pr))


; If a WISH LIST is needed, it should consist of 3 things:
; (1) a meaningful name for the function, (2) a signature,
; and (3) a purpose statement. See section 3.4 of HtDP-2.
