; PROBLEM: consider how steep hills might be in planning bike
; routes. Consider the following classification of steepness
; based on the grade of a hill:
;
; +---------------+-------------------+
; | Steepness     | Grade             |
; +---------------+-------------------+
; | Flat          | 0 to 2 percent    | 
; | Moderate      | 3 to 6 percent    |
; | Steep         | 7 to 10 percent   |
; +---------------+-------------------+
;
; a) Use HtDD to design a data definition for steepness 
; (call it Steepness).
;
; b) Use HtDD to design a data definition for hill grade 
; (call it HillGrade). Use an itemization of intervals for
; this data definition.


;; Type Comment, e.g. TLColor is one of: 0, 1, 2
;; HillGrade is one of:
;;  - Number[0, 2]
;;  - Number[3, 6]
;;  - Number[7, 10]


;; interp. steepness of a hill
; - Number[0, 2]  is considered flat
; - Number[3, 6]  is considered moderate
; - Number[7, 10] is considered steep


;; Examples
(define S1 1)
(define S5 5)
(define S8 8)


;; Template for a one argument function
;(define (fn-for-steepness s)
;  (cond [(<= 0 s 2) (... s)]
;        [(and (< 3 s) (<= s 6) (... s)]
;        [(and (< 6 s) (<= s 10) (... s)]))


;; Template Rules Used:
;;  one-of: 3 cases
;;  atomic non-distinct:  Number[0, 2]
;;  atomic non-distinct:  Number(3, 6]
;;  atomic non-distinct:  Number[7, 10]


;; *HtDF*: PROBLEM:
; c) Design a function called 'steepness' that takes a hill
; grade and produces the corresponding steepness rating
; according to our table.
;
;; Signature
;; =========
;; (HtDP-2: express how info. will be represented as data)
;; Steepness -> String


;; Purpose: (HtDP-2: what does the function compute?)
;; ==================================================
;; consume a Steepness and produce a hill grade label.


;; Stub; define examples; wrap each in a check-expect
;; ==================================================
;(define (steepness sn) "")               ;; Stub
;; given x, expect y                     ;; from HtDP-2
;; given a, expect b                     ;; from HtDP-2
(check-expect (steepness S1) "flat")
(check-expect (steepness S5) "moderate")
(check-expect (steepness S8) "steep")


;; Inventory -- template & constants
;; =================================
;(define (fn-for-steepness s)
;  (cond [(<= 0 s 2) (... s)]
;        [(and (< 3 s) (<= s 6) (... s)]
;        [(and (< 6 s) (<= s 10) (... s)]))


;; Code the body; test & debug
;; ===========================
(define (steepness sn)
  (cond [(<= 0 sn 2) "flat"]
        [(and (<= 3 sn) (<= sn 6)) "moderate"]
        [(and (<= 6 sn) (<= sn 10)) "steep"]))

; If a WISH LIST is needed, it should consist of 3 things:
; (1) a meaningful name for the function, (2) a signature,
; and (3) a purpose statement. See section 3.4 of HtDP-2.
