Exercise 5. Add the following two lines to the definitions area:

(define cat ~)
This is the cat used in the documentation.

The tilde (~) in the actual program is an image of a cat.

Create an expression that counts the number of pixels in the image. See exercise 1 for how to create expressions in DrRacket.

---IMAGE OPERATIONS (THERE ARE 3) USED HERE ---
(#2): image properties

***NOTES TO SELF***
You went on a mad search to find a function that counted pixels when you should
have realized the concept to apply to meet the need. The cat image is contained
within a RECTANGLE. Just calculate the area of the rectangle and the number of 
pixels are within (since pixels are the unit measure of an image).
