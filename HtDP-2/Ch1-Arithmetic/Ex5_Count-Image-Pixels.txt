Exercise 5. Add the following two lines to the definitions area:

(define cat ~)
This is the cat used in the documentation.

The tilde (~) in the actual program is an image of a cat.

Create an expression that counts the number of pixels in the image. See exercise 1 for how to create expressions in DrRacket.
