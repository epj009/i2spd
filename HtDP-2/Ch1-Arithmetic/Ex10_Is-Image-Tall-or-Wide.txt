Exercise 10: Add the following line to the definitions area:

(define cat ~)

Create an expression that computes whether the image is "tall" or "wide". An image should be labeled "tall" if its height is larger or equal to its width; otherwise it is "wide".

==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==

=========================


==THOUGHTS==
I had to refer back to exercise 5 to recall the image-height and image-width functions.

> (if (>= 7 6) "2nd" "3rd")
"2nd"

This shows that when the boolean evaluates TRUE, the 2nd expression is evaluated.

<<=CODE==>> My response:

(require 2htdp/image)

(define cat ~)

(define cat-h (image-height cat))
(define cat-w (image-width cat))

(if (>= cat-h cat-w) "tall" "wide")
