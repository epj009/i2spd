**===== 11/20 morning session; start @ 0555, finish @ 0605**

Starting an entirely new journal on an entirely new course of study, that is,
I'm leaving the UBC course for awhile with the hope of strengthening my 
programming foundation here in the How to Design Programs 2 book.

Up really early this morning but had to spend a big chunk of time catching-up
from being on the road all day yesterday in RC (TAACCCT "GroundWorks").

I should be able to get to the arithmetic exercises this evening and I should
also be able to move through them at a fair clip. I don't, however, want to be
hasty with the material because I can already see there are some good concept
lessons here.
