Exercise 13: Define a function that consumes two numbers, x and y, and that computes the distance of point (x,y) to the origin.

In exercise 1 you developed the right-hand side for this function. All you really need to do is add a function header. Remember this idea in case you are ever stuck with a function. Use the recipe of exercise 1 to develop the expression in the interactions area, and then write down the function definition.


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
From the text: the variables in a function header, i.e., the variables that follow the function name, are placeholders for unknown pieces of data in the function body.
=========================


==THOUGHTS==
Ah, so exercise 1 was developing the expression (in DrRacket's interaction area):

(define x 3)
(define y 4)

(sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y)))

And once the expression works properly, write a function definition.

<<=CODE==>> My response:

(define (distance-to-origin x y)
  (sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y))))
