Exercise 20: Define the function string-join, which consumes two strings and appends them with "_" in between. See exercise 2 for ideas.


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
Nothing new. You can look at string-append.
=========================


==THOUGHTS==
We're yet again asked to take a problem we did in the past (in this case exercise 2) and define a function.  So, here's the result of exercise 2:

(define prefix "hello")
(define suffix "world")

(string-append prefix "_" suffix)
============



<<=CODE==>> My response:

(define prefix "hello")
(define suffix "world")

(define (string-join x)
   (string-append prefix x suffix))
   
;; To make this work, type the following into DrRacket
;; > (string-join "_")
