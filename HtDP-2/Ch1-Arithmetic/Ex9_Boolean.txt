Exercise 9: Add the following two lines to the definitions area of DrRacket:

(define b1 true)
(define b2 false)

Create an expression that computes whether b1 is false or b2 is true. So in this particular case, the answer is false. (Why?)


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
boolean 'or' answers are almost always TRUE
boolean 'and' answers are almost always FALSE
boolean 'not' simply negates one argument
=========================

> (or b1 false)
true

> (and b1 false)
false

> (not b1)
false

> (or b2 false)
false

> (and b2 false)
false

> (not b2)
true

==THOUGHTS==
Pretty simple bit I can see how one could become easily confused.
Hah! You had the first one wrong but after returning from the game, you saw the problem and corrected it.
