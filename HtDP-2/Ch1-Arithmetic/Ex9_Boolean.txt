Exercise 9: Add the following two lines to the definitions area of DrRacket:

(define b1 true)
(define b2 false)

Create an expression that computes whether b1 is false or b2 is true. So in this particular case, the answer is false. (Why?)


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
boolean 'or' answers are almost always TRUE
boolean 'and' answers are almost always FALSE
boolean 'not' simply negates one argument
=========================


==THOUGHTS==
Pretty simple bit I can see how one could become easily confused.
Hah! You had the first one wrong but after returning from the game, you saw the problem and corrected it.

The question is confusing to me so I broke-down the words, in particular, whether.

whether - conjunction - used to introduce the first of two or more alternatives.

1st alternative: b1 is false
2nd alternative: b2 is true

Why? As stated and as given in the problem, b1 is true and b2 is false. The alternatives given are contradictions to this -- like a boolean 'not'. I also worked-out all alternatives for b1 and b2 below.
============

> (or b1 false)
true

> (and b1 false)
false

> (not b1)
false

> (or b2 false)
false

> (and b2 false)
false

> (not b2)
true
