Exercise #7.

EXERCISE DESCRIPTION
Use the picture primitives to create the image of a simple boat.

==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
Play with triangles given known sides and angles.
=========================

==THOUGHTS==
The concept of combining functions is really starting to make sense.

<<=CODE==>> My response:

(require 2htdp/image)

(define left-hull
  (overlay/xy
  (square 35 "solid" "black")
  -40 -3.5
  (triangle/sss 45 70 80 "solid" "black")))

(define right-hull
  (triangle/sss 70 45 80 "solid" "black"))

(define composed-hull
  (overlay/xy right-hull
