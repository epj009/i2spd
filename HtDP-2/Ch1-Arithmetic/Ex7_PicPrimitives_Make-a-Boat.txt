Exercise #7.

EXERCISE DESCRIPTION
Use the picture primitives to create the image of a simple boat.

==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
Play with triangles given known sides and angles. As Peter mentioned yesterday, many students are averse to digging-in and reading the documentation. One must love to read and write documentation! :-)
=========================

==THOUGHTS==
The concept of combining functions is really starting to make sense.

<<=CODE==>> My response:

(require 2htdp/image)

(define left-hull
  (overlay/xy
  (square 35 "solid" "black")
  -40 -3.5
  (triangle/sss 45 70 80 "solid" "black")))

(define right-hull
  (triangle/sss 70 45 80 "solid" "black"))

(define composed-hull
  (overlay/xy right-hull
    -35 0
     left-hull))

(define superstructure
;; The polygon code below is from the documentation.
  (polygon (list (make-posn 0 0)
                 (make-posn -10 20)
                 (make-posn 60 0)
                 (make-posn -10 -20))
           "solid"
           "black"))

(define ship
  (underlay/xy superstructure
     -28 20
     composed-hull))
