Exercise 25: After studying the costs of a show, the owner discovered several ways of lowering the cost. As a result of his improvements, he no longer has a fixed cost. He now simply pays $1.50 per attendee.

Modify both programs to reflect this change. When the programs are modified, test them again with ticket prices of $3, $4, and $5 and compare the results.

This will be for program #1.

No new documentation searches needed for this program.

==THOUGHTS==
When I simply set fixed expenses PER_PERFORMANCE to 0:
> (profit 2.9)
1244.1

When I made the change to expenses PER_ATTENDEE to 1.5, i.e.

(+ (* AVERAGE_ATTENDANCE FIXED_EXPENSE_PER_ATTENDEE)

> (profit 2.9)
1064.1

This is the exact same number as the original scenario with $180 fixed expense per performance. Need to systematically play with profit scenarios.
