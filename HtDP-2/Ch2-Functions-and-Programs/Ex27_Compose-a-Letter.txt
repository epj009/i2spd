==THOUGHTS==
;; Consider a program for filling in letter templates. It consumes the first and last ;; name of the addressee, an opening with the letter body, and a closing:
(define (letter fst lst signature-name)
  (string-append
    (opening fst)
    "\n\n"
    (body fst lst)
    "\n\n"
    (closing signature-name)))
 
(define (opening fst)
  (string-append "Dear " fst ","))
 
(define (body fst lst)
  (string-append
   "We have discovered that all people with the last name " "\n"
   lst " have won our lottery. So, " fst ", " "\n"
   "hurry and pick up your prize."))
 
(define (closing signature-name)
  (string-append
   "Sincerely,"
   "\n\n"
   signature-name))
