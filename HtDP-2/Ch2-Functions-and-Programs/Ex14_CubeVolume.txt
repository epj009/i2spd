Exercise 14: Define the function cube-volume, which accepts the length of a side of a cube and computes its volume. If you have time, consider defining cube-surface, too.


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
Check the sqr function in the Racket documentation:  (sqr x)
There isn't a cube function built-in.
=========================


==THOUGHTS==
Volume of a cube = x^3.
Surface of a cube = 6a^2.

Step 1 (per the last lesson) is to work-out the expression in DrRacket's interaction area.
Step 2 is to write the function header.

<<=CODE==>> My response:
;; For the volume of a cube.
(define (cube-volume x)
   (* x x x))
   
;; OR
(define (cube-volume x)
   (* (sqr x) x))

   
;; For the surface area of a cube.
(define (cube-surface x)
  (* (sqr x) 6))
  
;; OR
(define (cube-surface x)
  (* (* x x) 6))
