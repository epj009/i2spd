Exercise 22: Define the function string-delete, which consumes a string and a number i and which deletes the ith position from str. Assume i is a number between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the given string (exclusive). See exercise 4 for ideas. Can string-delete deal with empty strings?

;; for [phase#1], this works...
(define (string-delete s n)
   (if (= (string-length s) 0) "empty string!!"
          (string-append (substring s 0 n) (substring s (+ n 1) 9))))

;; get rid of the number 9 in the last substring command

<<=CODE==>> My response:
;; this DOES deal with empty strings
(define (string-delete s n)
   (if (= (string-length s) 0) "empty string!!"
          (string-append
            (substring s 0 n) (substring s (+ n 1) (string-length s)))))
