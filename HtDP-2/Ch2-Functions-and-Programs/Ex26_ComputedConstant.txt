Exercise 26: Define constants for the price optimization program so that the price sensitivity of attendance (15 people for every 10 cents) becomes a computed constant. 


==DOCUMENTATION LESSONS==
No new documentation searches and/or lessons.
=========================


==THOUGHTS==
[15]:    +/- change in attendance with each +/- change in ticket price
[$0.10]: +/- change in ticket price

First look at how this is used in calculations; it's an easy change and is commented below.

Calculations remain consistent, i.e. the profit for a $2.90 ticket price stays exactly the same. One could imagine conducting more rigorous testing.

> (profit 2.9)
