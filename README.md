How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition
===================================

I recently worked through a massively open online course (MOOC) offered through Coursera entitled "[Introduction to Systematic Program Design, Part
1](https://www.coursera.org/course/programdesign)". It is a 10-week long course provided by the University of British Columbia. I got through the first three weeks and felt that I hadn't grasped the material, so I went back to day #1 and started over. In a nutshell, I spent 8 weeks doing the first three weeks. When I found myself in week 3 again, I decided I'd stop working on the course and instead start working through the text that inspired the course, page by page. That's what I'm doing now.

The main text referred to is "[How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html)", which I started working through starting on 11/22/2013. However long it takes to get through this book, that's how long it will take me. Learning to design programs and become a programmer is part of my "[5-year plan](http://chrisbeattie.org/)".

The text authors created DrRacket, an operating system and language set used for teaching via their dialect of Scheme, known as the "[Racket language](http://racket-lang.org/)".

All of my study files are located here. You'll see that it's not possible to
simply view the \*.rkt source files because DrRacket is needed to open them -- this is a deliberate design decision by the DrRacket development team. DrRacket's focus is to teach people how to design and develop programs, and as such, files are encoded when a person chooses to use one of the teaching languages. Right now I'm using BSL, the beginning student language.

Here are a couple of other links you may find interesting:

* [Simply Scheme, 2nd Edition, Harvey & Wright](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html)
* [Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), Abelson &
  Sussman](http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/)
* [The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition, R. Kent

* [The Little Schemer](http://scottn.us/downloads/The_Little_Schemer.pdf)
  (teaches recursion)

Cheers, and if you haven't explored the world of Lisp and Scheme, I'd  recommend at least giving them a look. It's all pretty fascinating. :-)
